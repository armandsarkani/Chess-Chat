## General Instructions:

**For the GUI version:**

For the client program, first enter a username and password and click either "register" or "login".
Then, a list of your friends will be shown. You can add and remove friends, or chat with an existing friend. 
Once you've opened a chat with a friend, you can play chess by clicking the "Chess" button (or typing the word "Chess").
To launch the server program, simply specify a port number.

**For the command line version:**

For the client program, first specify a hostname and port number. Enter **r** if you wish to register as a new user, or **l** if you wish to login. Then enter a username and a password. Then add or remove friends if necessary, and type **Chat** to chat with a user that is your friend.
To play a game of chess with a friend, simply type in **Chess,** and then type in the coordinate of the move you wish to make (i.e. e2e4). The person that initiates a chess game will automatically be the white player.
To launch the server program, simply specify a port number.
